You are very charismatic and motivating...and you know it. You are a warm, enthusiastic, people-person, who is typically very bright and full of potential. You have a tendency to become very excited about things, and your enthusiasm is contagious. Your experience may have taught you that you can “talk your way out of most anything.” You genuinely love life, and are trying to make the very best of it.\r\n\r\nYou have many talents and abilities, and you tend to be proficient in almost anything you have interest. With such a broad range of possibilities, it is likely that you will go through several careers in your lifetime. Other people might think that you are wandering aimlessly, however, you are quite consistent, and almost always land on your feet. You have very strong core values, and you care about living up to them. To remain content, everything that you do should be in line with those values. You have the need to feel like you're being true to yourself and doing what you feel to be the right thing to do. You see life as having deep meaning, and you search for inner peace. You are adaptable to change, as long as it helps you become a better person. Most of the time, you are an intense individual that inspires others. You are aware, and possibly somewhat in fear of, loosing your center and purpose.\r\n\r\nYou are well aware of your tendency to become distracted. To be as effective as possible, make sure and stay focused on your projects and goals. If you get plenty of “alone” time, it is easier for you to maintain your momentum in a positive direction and eventually reach a successful conclusion. On average, you experience more success then most. The level of your success, to date, has been in direct proportion to your ability to focus and intensify your endeavors. However, (and this isn't something you don't already know), you may run the risk of becoming excited about a new possibility and thereby leaving other projects undone.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that you maintain healthy relationships. You have a strong need for people to like you. When you were younger, it may have been your tendency to be insincere or even outlandish when trying to be accepted. However, once you learned to balance your need to be true to yourself with your need for acceptance, you excelled at bringing out the best in others. You are typically well-liked because of it. You are exceptionally good at understanding people, even within a very short period of time; and, because you are a flexible person, it is easy for you to relate to people at their level. You are one that doesn’t enjoy getting caught up in the “details” of life. It is your tendency to be oblivious to them. When you are required to perform tasks that are detailed oriented, you typically don't enjoy yourself; it may even be a source of frustration for your family members when you aren't has engaged as you should be.</p><p>If you have ever had a time in your life when you’ve lost course, you were likely manipulative...and very good at it. Your ability to communicate makes you quite flattering. Likely, you’re currently centered and comfortable with your course of direction because it coincides with your core values.\r\n\r\nAt times, you erroneously judge others. You have an uncanny ability to perceive the truth about people or about your environment, but when you try to apply judgment to your perceptions you often come to the wrong conclusions. Because of your personality traits, you need to be very careful when judging others.\r\n\r\nAs you hone your follow-through skills, you'll have fulfilling personal and social relationships. It is very easy for you to become bored, and you crave excitement in your life. You get along best with those who are adaptable to change.\r\n\r\nYour kids will find, at times, that you are hard to figure out. Sometimes you are their best friend, and sometimes you are their dictator. But because of your strong values, in the end, if you constantly keep this in check, they should come away with a deep appreciation for you and what you stand for, and they will always know how to enjoy life.\r\n\r\nYou are basically a happy person. You might become irritated, if you're confined to a strict regimen or any kind of mundane task; but overall, you are optimistic and upbeat. As long as you're excited about what you are doing, you will tend to do well with little to no supervision; you will likely find yourself in business for yourself.\r\n\r\nIt may be easy for you to get stressed, because you are so aware and sensitive to your environment. You positively don't like to be controlled, manipulated or labeled. You also respect the individuality of others. \r\n\r\nYou have a charming, smart, people-oriented personality and normally don't have a problem taking risks. In order to fully understand and implement each of the laws that govern the BiggerGains Mindset, it will be imperative that you make a commitment to finish every step, in its entirety, before moving to the next step or skipping ahead. Remember, your personality requires that you focus on your follow-up or follow-through skills; and this will facilitate you becoming a well-rounded person.", :created_at => "2013-08-16 13:47:49", :updated_at => "2013-08-16 15:03:44" },
  { :name => "ESFJ", :title => "The Concerned Chameleon ", :message => "You're a people person. You love people and care about what they care about. You generally view people in a positive light, and you have a tendency to bring out the best in others. You're good at understanding others, and their point of view. You are supportive because you have a very strong desire to be liked by others. And, people generally like to be around you because you make them feel good about themselves. \r\n\r\nYou are almost always dependable, and you take your jobs very seriously. You're good at taking action and will likely do what ever it takes to get the job done. But you have a tendency to focus too strongly on the details and can easily get caught up doing \"good things\" while neglecting to do the \"essential things\". You value having a secure, stable life, and sometimes this is a hindrance to your freedom because you fear taking \"perceived risks\".\r\n\r\nYou like approval from others, as you feel deep down that it helps your self-esteem. You are most likely to be offended when people are apathetic and unkind. You are very caring and sensitive to the needs of others. You're a giving person and your fulfillment comes from the happiness of others. You want to be appreciated for all that you are and all that you do. Upon first hearing about it, you may have trouble recognizing a negative truth about someone you deeply care about. \r\n\r\nWhen around other people, you are trying to read their perceptions of you, because of your need to be liked, and to feel in control. You often adapt your behavior to conform to whomever you are with at the time. You don't like to hear this about yourself because of your need to be liked, but remember that this knowledge can help you as you empathize with others, and be a positive force for good in their lives. \r\n\r\nYour value system is determined by your external circumstances. You probably have strong opinions about the way things should be, and you're probably not inhibited about communicating those ideas. But, you compare your values to the environment around you, instead of your inner core value system. For example, you may have strong moral values, but it's determined by the morally strong community that you live in, instead of your inner core values. \r\n\r\nYou like to be in control of your environment. You work best in structured, organized environments and you most likely try to create these environments where they do not exist. \r\n\r\nYou respect authority and the laws that govern society. You tend to be more conventional and do things the traditional way, because of your need for security. Sometimes you blindly accept the traditional ways of doing things without asking yourself; \"Is this the best way to go\" or \"Is there a better way out there\". \r\n\r\nIn extreme cases, or when you were less mature, you may have been a little controlling, or too sensitive, assuming ill intent where none actually exists. \r\n\r\nYou enjoy tradition and security, and meaningful contact with others.

You absorb much through your keen intuition.\r\n\r\nYou are very people-focused. You live in a world of people possibilities. More so than any other type of person, your particular personality provides you with excellent people skills. You naturally understand and care about people, and have a special talent for bringing out the best in others. One of your interests in life, is providing love and support for other people. You are focused on understanding and encouraging others. You make things happen for people, and you derive personal satisfaction from this. \r\n\r\nBecause your people skills are extraordinary, you have the ability to influence others. You can easily get under people's skin and obtain the reactions that you seek. Your motives are usually unselfish, but if they are less than ideal, you may have a reputation for being manipulative. \r\n\r\nYou are so externally focused that it's especially important that you take time out for yourself. This may be difficult for you, because you have the tendency to engage in self-defeating thoughts. Constructively speaking, it’s healthy for you to avoid excessive solitude, and fill your life with activities involving other people. At times, you define your life's direction and priorities according to other people's needs, and may not be aware of your own. It's natural for you to place other people's needs above your own. \r\n\r\nYou tend to be more reserved about exposing yourself than other extraverted types. You have strong-felt beliefs, sometimes you refrain from expressing them; especially when doing so interferes with the well-being of others. Because your strongest interest lies in being a catalyst of change for others, you're likely to interact with others on their own level in a chameleon-like manner rather than as an individual. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say you don’t have valuable opinions. You do have standards and principles, which you are able to express very clearly and succinctly; it's just that you will usually only express them, as long as they're not too personal. You are in many ways expressive and open, but you tend to be more focused on being responsive and supportive. When faced with a conflict between a strongly-held value and serving another person's needs, you are very likely to value the other person's needs. \r\n\r\nSometimes you may feel quite lonely... even when surrounded by people. This feeling of isolation may be heightened by the tendency to not reveal your true self. \r\n\r\nPeople love you. You are often very fun to be with, and, in turn, truly understand and love people. You are typically very straight-forward and honest. You usually convey great self-confidence, and have the ability to do many different things. You are generally bright, full of potential, energetic and fast-paced. You usually excel at that which captures your interest. \r\n\r\nYou prefer your possessions to be well-organized and work hard to maintain structure and resolve ambiguity. You have a tendency to be fussy, especially regarding your home environment. \r\n\r\nIn the work place, you do well in positions where you deal with people. You are a natural for the social committee. Your uncanny ability to understand people and articulate what needs to be said is calming, and makes you a natural for counseling. As a “educator,” you enjoy being the center of attention and do very well in situations where you can inspire and lead others. \r\n\r\nYou do not like dealing with impersonal reasoning. You don't understand or appreciate its merit, and will be unhappy in situations where you're forced to deal with logic and facts without any connection to a human element. Living in a world of people possibilities, you enjoy developing your plans more than you do basking in your achievements. Easily excited about future possibilities, you may find yourself bored and restless with what is occurring in the present. \r\n\r\nYou have a special gift with people, and are genuinely happy when you can use that gift to help others. You get more satisfaction by serving others. Your legitimate interest in humanity and your exceptional intuitive awareness of people makes you able to draw out even the most reserved individuals. \r\n\r\nYou have a strong need for close, intimate relationships, and will put forth sustained effort to create and maintain these relationships. Once committed, you are very loyal and trustworthy to the relationship. \r\n\r\nIf you have not fully developed your ability to comprehend and evaluate a situation, you may have difficulty making good decisions, and rely heavily on other people in the decision-making process. There is also a chance you may not be able to visualize the possibilities and judge too quickly based on established value systems or social rules, without really understanding the current situation. It is likely that you are extremely sensitive to criticism, and tend to worry excessively and feel guilty. If this is the case, you are likely manipulative and have the challenge of controlling others. \r\n\r\nIn general, you are charming, warm, gracious, creative and diverse, with richly developed insights that allow you to understand what makes other people tick. This special ability to see the potential growth of others, combined with a genuine drive to assist people, makes you a truly, valuable individual. As giving and caring as you are, you need to remember to value your own needs, and prioritize effectively. <p>A person with your personality type generally displays the following traits: \r\n\r\n• Genuinely and warmly interested in people \r\n• Value people's feelings \r\n• Value structure and organization \r\n• Prize harmony, and good at creating it \r\n• Exceptionally good people skills \r\n• Dislike impersonal logic and analysis \r\n• Strong organizational desires \r\n• Loyal and honest \r\n• Creative and imaginative \r\n• Enjoy variety and new challenges \r\n• Get personal satisfaction from helping others \r\n• Extremely sensitive to criticism \r\n• Need approval from others to bolster self-worth. \r\n\r\nThe flexibility of these characteristics provides you leeway in choosing a profession. As long as you're in a supportive environment in which you can work with people and are presented with a sufficient amount of diverse challenges to stimulate your creativity, you will likely do very well. \r\n", :created_at => "2013-08-16 15:06:11", :updated_at => "2013-08-16 15:06:11" },

You are very respectful to laws and traditions, and you have a clearly-defined value system. You don't have much tolerance for those who don't honor ethics. \r\n\r\nYou are natural leader. You have a clear vision of the end product, and what’s required to accomplish it. You work hard to make sure projects get completed according to your specifications. You tend to be more demanding because you have such high standards. You won't hesitate to criticize those who you feel don't meet your expectations, and you are very up-front and honest with people, and you simply tell them how you see it. \r\n\r\nYou are an upstanding member of the community, and you value the responsibilities that are inherent to such prestige. You like to be involved with others, and you particularly enjoy events that are centered on family, work, church, and society. \r\n\r\nBe mindful of your tendency to be inflexible and overly meticulous. You believe so strongly in your own ideas that you tend to fall into the rut of \"Pride\"; and in so doing, fail to recognize others and their alternative perspectives… viewpoints that may be an improvement on your own. When you become too concerned with the details, you can lose sight of the big picture. Your logical approach has the potential to cause problems in situations where emotional understanding is more important. You may even hurt people's feelings by trying to rationalize, when all the situation requires is sympathy. \r\n\r\nWhen under pressure or stressed, you tend to feel like you're operating independently, doing everything by yourself, and that no one appreciates your efforts. You tend to feel like others take you for granted, and they don't understand all that you do for them.\r\n\r\nYou value order and structure in society, and you feel compelled to do your part to maintain these values. You sustain a responsible household; you most likely vote; you get involved in your community, and do whatever you can to uphold the security of the society in which you live. \r\n\r\nWhen you commit to a task, you give it your all. You give one-hundred percent in your career, relationships, religious obligations, and community. You carry out all your responsibilities to the best of your ability, as long as you understand and value what the task represents.

You may even play the devil's advocate, just for fun. When you express your core values, however, you may feel awkward and speak abruptly and present yourself as overbearing. \r\n\r\nAttorneys have a similar profile. You are quick to understand, and you are quite able to objectively and logically react to a situation. \r\n\r\nYour actions and decisions are based on an objective list of rules or laws. Were you a criminal defense attorney, it is highly probable that you would look for loop holes in the law to win a case. You would deem your course of action as completely fair and ethical because it falls within the bounds of law. It is important for you to pay attention to how you may be viewed by others. Reviewing the attorney example, many would consider you unethical or dishonest. Remember that you have a responsibility to make the world a better place, and generating benefits for others lies at the core of that responsibility. \r\n\r\nYou are vulnerable in the sense that you fail to make sufficient note of the human aspect of decision-making. Be careful to recognize the personal element of any given situation. Just because you have a good sense for logic doesn't mean you don't have to address your own feelings and those of others. Remember to not isolate yourself. \r\n\r\nYou could easily dismiss the important details of your life and become overly harsh or aggressive. Listen to what other people have to say, particularly when it pertains to you. \r\n\r\nIn stressful situations, you may lose your ability to generate productive possibilities and thereby become obsessed with trivial details. At the time, these details might seem vitally important to you; however, in these situations, you don’t take the time to step back and see the “big picture.” \r\n\r\nOverall, you are upbeat and have a great sense of vision. You highly value knowledge, and will most likely be a “life-long learner.” Your world is full of possibilities, and you are excited about new concepts and new challenges. In the face of opposition, you are good at improvising and have the creative answer. Creative, smart, and inquisitive, a world of possibilities lies before you. It’s vital that you remember others as you strive to become a well-rounded individual. ", :created_at => "2013-08-16 15:08:23", :updated_at => "2013-08-16 15:08:23" },

You are the kind of person who likes to take charge. \r\n\r\nUp until now, you have been, most likely, career-minded. You enjoy finding solutions for the problems you find in your environment. You are likely a leader in the business world, because of your innate ability to solve problems and see the big picture. You are likely a model employee, someone that people can count on, someone that demonstrates good leadership.\r\n\r\nYou are very efficient. It irritates you to see inefficiency or mistakes being made. This may cause you to be impatient, harsh or overbearing toward the people around you. You need to work on caring about other people's feelings because it’s difficult for you to see the world from an alternative perspective. You need to care more about other people’s opinions and their feelings, if you want to work on being a more, well-rounded person. To be a more effective leader, seek the collaboration of others. Don't alienate yourself from the productive input of others. Friends, co-workers, and family members often wish that you would be more patient and understanding. \r\n\r\nIt is easy for you to fall into the rut of selfishness, the rut of being too busy, and also the rut of pride. Make sure that your driving force toward goals and accomplishments doesn't move you farther away from the things that matter most. Make sure not to pat yourself on the back too often. Your drive and powerful approach to life will do you good, if they are kept in check. \r\n\r\nYou are very effective at making decisions, but also very opinionated, and like to make your opinions known. Beware of making hasty decisions. Be patient to evaluate and understand all the variables; if you don’t, the outcome will be poor. In your case, being hurried is a weakness because you may not yet understand how to act upon your ideas, or you may be inconsistent. Possibly, it’s your tendency to give orders and expect immediate action...remember to get outside of yourself more often; this will make you a more effective leader.\r\n\r\nEven though you are generally not attuned to the feelings of others, you do have a sentimental side; but you tend to keep this close to the vest. Talking about your emotions feels unnatural. Depending on what has happened in your life, you may hold onto suppressed emotions that can cause you psychological injury... and sometimes rather serious problems. \r\n\r\nYou consider yourself a people-person. You are stimulated and energized by your environment and the people around you. You find it very rewarding to have a lively, challenging conversation. You especially respect people who are able to stand up to you, and argue persuasively in defense of their point of view. Because most people find you intimidating, there aren't many who stand up to you. You have a very forceful, commanding presence, high self-confidence, and excellent communication skills. Even the most confident individuals may experience moments of doubt when debating a point with you. Make sure that you stand for that which is based on sound principles.\r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance that you have a beautiful, well-furnished, and efficiently run home. \r\n\r\nYou care about being well-educated, and the exceptional education of your children. If you are married, being a devoted husband or wife is of the highest priority. You like to take charge in the home. You prefer to associate with those who demonstrate a strong self-esteem and independent thinking. Because of your ability to excel in the workplace, you spend quite a bit of time away from home—physically and/or mentally.\r\n\r\nRemember to seek for balance in your life.

You are very observant and this helps you determine the true intentions of others. You sometimes use these abilities to control situations and get what you want. You are inclined to “get the job done,” even if it means not strictly following the rules.

Unfortunately, you are prone to make decisions based solely on the facts and often fail to consider the feeling of others; be aware of the effect this may have on your relationships. \r\n\r\nNot concerned with the hypothetical or theoretical, you would rather get things done than speculate on how things should be done. You may have had trouble academically, because of your perspective on theory and the practical application of what you were being taught.

You can't be confined to structured or routine tasks; and if you are, you will likely experience discord and become bored.

Your talent to inspire others, and get them to take action, is an asset; however, you sometimes struggle to consistently follow through and finish what you start.

You have an extraordinary understanding of people and circumstances. You are sensitive to feelings or promptings that provide insight into situations. You may hold back or be reluctant to share these intuitions with others because you cannot logically explain them. You protect your inner-self and tend to be more private—or even secretive. \r\n\r\nYou are sensitive and compassionate towards people, and you always try to avoid upsetting others.

You are a \"good citizen\" upon which others can depend. Those with whom you associate are comfortable because they know you will do the right thing for your family and community. While you generally take things very seriously, you usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a lot of fun - especially at family or work-related gatherings. \r\n\r\nYou tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from others and therefore not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. If you are able to see a valid reason for deviation, you will often support that effort. Ultimately, more often you tend to believe that things should follow according to procedures and plans. In the past you may have been overly obsessed with structure, and insisted on doing everything \"by the book\". \r\n\r\nYou are extremely dependable and follow through with your commitments. This trait sometimes creates a greater workload then you can reasonably handle; but because of your sense of “duty” you often have a hard time saying “no.” For this reason, you most likely work long hours, and could be unwittingly taken advantage of. \r\n\r\nYou will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts of energy into doing any task which you see as important to fulfilling a greater goal. However, you will often resist putting energy into things which don't make sense to you, or for which you can't see practical application or benefit. You prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when the situation requires it. You like to be accountable for your actions, and enjoy being in positions of authority. You have little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the practical application is very clear. \r\n\r\nYou have a tremendous respect for facts and are inclined to glean and retain all the information you can. You may have difficulty understanding a theory or idea which is different from your own perspective. However, if you are shown the importance or relevance of the idea by someone who you respect or care about, for you the “idea” becomes “fact” and easily internalized. Once you support a cause or idea, you are valiant to ensure that you are lending support where support is needed. \r\n\r\nYou are not naturally in tune with your own feelings and the feelings of others. You may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs, as they are presented. Being a perfectionist, you have a tendency to take other people's efforts for granted—as you similarly take your own efforts for granted. Remember to pat people on the back once in awhile. \r\n\r\nYou are likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to others. However, your strong sense of duty and the ability to see what needs to be done in any situation usually allows you to overcome any natural reservations. You are usually quite supportive and caring of the people that you love. Once you realize the emotional needs of those who are close to you, you put forth effort to meet those needs. \r\n\r\nYou are extremely faithful and loyal.

You are a diligent worker and don’t allow obstacles to get in the way of performing your duties. Unfortunately, you probably don’t give yourself enough credit for your achievements and see your accomplishments simply as the natural fulfillment of your obligations. \r\n\r\nYou have a great sense of space and function, and artistic appreciation.

You are acutely aware of your senses, and want to be in surroundings which fit your need for structure, order, and beauty. \r\n\r\nUnder stress, you may fall into \"crisis mode\" and see nothing but all of the possibilities of what \"could go wrong\".

You constantly take in information about people and situations that is personally important to them, and store it away. This tremendous store of information is surprisingly accurate, because you have an exceptional memory about things that are important to your value system. For example, it would not be uncommon for you to remember a particular facial expression or conversation in precise detail years after the event occurred, if that specific situation made an impression on you. \r\n\r\nYou have a very clear idea of the way you believe things should be, and you strive to make this perception reality. You value security and kindness, and respect traditions and laws. You tend to believe that existing systems are there because they work; and, therefore, not likely to buy into doing things in a new way; unless you're concretely shown why it’s better than the established, “tried and true” method. \r\n\r\nYou learn best through hands-on experience, rather than by reading about something in a book, or applying theory. For this reason, you are not likely to be found doing things that require a lot of conceptual analysis or theory. You value practical application. Traditional methods of higher education, which require a lot of theorizing and abstract thought-process, are likely to be laborious for you. You learn a task best when shown its practical application. Once the task is learned, and its practical importance understood, you will faithfully and tirelessly carry through the task to completion; therefore, you are extremely dependable. \r\n\r\nYou have a well-developed sense of space, function, and aesthetic appeal. It follows that you're likely to have a beautifully furnished, functional home. You would make an extremely good interior decorator / designer. This special ability, combined with your sensitivity to other's feelings and desires, makes you likely to be a great gift-giver… finding “just the right gift,” one that’s truly appreciated by the recipient. \r\n\r\nMore so than other types, you are extremely aware of your own internal feelings, as well as those of other’s. You may not express your feelings often, preferring to keep things private. If they are negative feelings, they may build up inside you, until they turn into firm judgments against individuals; and, for you, these judgments may be difficult to dismiss once they are set. Exercise caution, and remember that productive communication is critical for you to have a well-rounded, well-balanced, and fulfilling life. Most likely, you have learned to express yourself, and find outlets for your powerful emotions. \r\n\r\nJust as you are not likely to express your feelings, you are also not likely to divulge that you aware of how others are feeling. However, you will speak up when you feel another individual really needs help; and in such cases, you can truly help others become aware of their own feelings. \r\n\r\nYou feel a strong sense of responsibility and duty, and you take your responsibilities very seriously. Others can count on you to follow through with commitments and naturally tend to rely on you. You have a difficult time saying \"no\" when asked to do something and may feel over-burdened. In these situations, you do not usually express your discord to others, because you intensely dislike conflict, and because you tend to place other people's needs over your own. You need to learn to identify, value, and express your own needs, if you wish to avoid becoming over-worked and taken advantage of. \r\n\r\nYou deal with circumstances best when you receive positive feedback from others. In the absence of positive feedback, or in the face of criticism, you can get discouraged and may even become depressed. When down on yourself or under great stress, you begin to imagine all of the things that could go wrong in your life. When stressed, it is likely that you have feelings of inadequacy, and become convinced that \"everything is all wrong\", or \"I can't do anything right\". Make sure to keep your stress levels low to have a better chance of keeping these self-defeating thoughts from taking over your life. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, you are warm, generous, and dependable. You have many special gifts to offer, like your sensitivity toward others, and your strong ability to keep things running smoothly. You need to remember to not be overly critical of yourself, and to give yourself some of the warmth and love which you so freely dispense to those around you. \r\n\r\nYou have two basic traits which have shaped what you have seen as your best career direction: first, you are extremely interested and in-tune with how other people are feeling; and second, you enjoy creating structure and order and are extremely proficient at it. Make sure to make good use of your exceptional observation skills and determine what people want or need, and then use your excellent organizational abilities to create a structured plan or environment to initiate what people want. Your sense of space and function, combined with your awareness of aesthetic quality, also gives you unique abilities in the more practical, artistic endeavors, such as interior decorating and clothing design. \r\n\r\nPeople with your profile tend to gravitate toward the following professions: \r\n\r\n• Interior Decorator \r\n• Designer \r\n• Nurse \r\n• Administrator and Manager \r\n• Administrative Assistant \r\n• Child Care / Early Childhood Development \r\n• Social Work / Counselor \r\n• Paralegal \r\n• Clergy / Religious Worker \r\n• Office Manager \r\n• Shopkeeper \r\n• Bookkeeper \r\n• Home Economics \r\nRemember that even though you are good at these types of livelihoods, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a passion for them.

You are rather flexible and tolerant, unless the validity of your beliefs is challenged. \r\n\r\nYou struggle with making decisions based on feelings. Your inclination towards logic is so strong that you have trouble accounting for the emotional or personal ramifications your decisions often require. You generally have a hard time understanding the feelings of others and therefore, you are an \"idea person\" rather than a \"people person\". \r\n\r\nYou may not understand the value of entertaining the feelings of others. You may have difficulties within your close, intimate relationships. If you aren't in an environment where you can exercise your strong abilities, you may become overly critical and sarcastic with others or perhaps even negative and cynical. Exercise caution; it is impossible to become successful if you remain in the rut of negativity and pessimism. \r\n\r\nYou are independent, unconventional, and original. Your fresh ideas and new theories can introduce and produce grand developments… if you are free to think without restraints, and able to express and implement your ideas. It will serve you to pay very close attention to your perceptions of others. Don’t be quick to pass judgment or be critical; it will hold you back from the truly, free life that you seek.

  { :name => "INTJ", :title => "The Systems Architect ", :message => "You are a person who is full of ideas, always planning and strategizing. Intellect and capability are very important to you, and you have high standards when it comes to both. You are always striving to increase your knowledge and become more competent. \r\n\r\nYou are very observant of the world around you, and your observations spark within you new ideas and possibilities. You are good at understanding new concepts, but you're primary focus is applying them. In order for you to understand a new idea, you have to apply it and draw a conclusion based on your experience. \r\n\r\nYou are able to develop ideas into systems for others to follow, but you may have trouble expressing your ideas in terms that others can understand. You don't see the value in explaining everything to everybody, but you will explain why and how your plans will work to those whom you feel have the capability of understanding. \r\n\r\nYou are a natural leader, although you may not jump at the chance to lead. Instead, you usually step forward when you feel it is time for you take over. You are very good at reading situations, strategizing, and adapting to changes, but you may have trouble implementing your ideas. \r\n\r\nYou often think that your judgments are accurate. When misunderstandings occur, you tend to blame the other person's limitations rather than your inability to express yourself. This may cause you to disregard input from others and become somewhat arrogant in your views. Pride will hold you back from freedom, if you disregard valuable input from others and do what you've always done…you’ll get what you've always gotten. On the other hand, your commitment to always find the best strategy may help you become more open to hearing alternatives. \r\n\r\nWhen under a great deal of stress, you can easily become obsessed with minutia and the details you would not normally consider important. Be careful not to think yourself better than others...you are intelligent, but humility is equally as valuable. ", :created_at => "2013-08-16 15:16:36", :updated_at => "2013-08-16 15:16:36" },
  { :name => "ISTP", :title => "The Mechanically-inclined Adventurist ", :message => "You have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. You're good at logical analysis, and like to use it to solve practical problems and concerns. You have excellent reasoning skills, although you're not interested in theories or concepts unless they are effective in practical application. You like to take things apart and see the way they work. \r\n\r\nYou have an adventurous nature, and are likely attracted to motorcycles, ATV's, airplanes, sky diving, surfing, etc. You thrive on action, and are normally fearless. Fiercely independent, you require “space” to make your own decisions. You do not have a high regard for rules and regulations, as this would prohibit your ability to \"do your own thing\". Your sense of adventure and desire for constant action makes you prone to becoming bored and disinterested rather quickly. \r\n\r\nYou are loyal to your causes and beliefs, and are a firm believer that people should be treated with equity and fairness. Although you do not respect the rules of the \"System\", you faithfully follow your own rules and guidelines for behavior. You normally would never take part in something which violates your personal laws. You are most likely extremely loyal and faithful to those closest to you. \r\n\r\nYou like (and need) alone time, because this is when you can sort things out in your mind most clearly. You can absorb large quantities of impersonal facts from the external world, and sort through those facts, making judgments, especially when you are alone. \r\n\r\nYou are an action-oriented person. You like to stay busy and be effective. You are not someone who is likely to sit behind a desk all day and do long-range planning. Adaptable and spontaneous, you respond to that which is immediately before you. Most likely, you have strong technical skills, with the ability to be an effective, technical leader. You focus on details and those things which are practical. You have a strong sense of expediency and grasp details, enabling you to make quick, effective decisions. \r\n\r\nYou avoid making judgments based on personal values; you feel that judgments and decisions should be made impartially, based on the fact. You are not naturally attuned to how you are affecting others. Not paying enough attention to your own feelings, and even distrusting them, you may try to ignore them. You are challenged when trying to distinguish between emotional reactions and value judgments. Though this is likely your challenge, search for ways to overcome this problem. You have the ability, but it will require focused, personal effort. \r\n\r\nIf you are ever over-stressed, you may exhibit rash emotional outbursts of anger, or on the other hand, be overwhelmed by emotions and feelings which you feel compelled to share with people (often inappropriately). If you are ever down on yourself, it is because you judge yourself by your inability to perform a specific task. You will then approach the task in a grim, emotional state, and sometimes expect the worst. \r\n\r\nYou are excellent when met with a crisis. You're probably a good athlete, and have very good hand-eye coordination. You usually follow through with your projects and effectively tie up the loose ends. You usually don't have difficulty in school, because you are an introvert. You likely have well-developed and effective logic skills. You are usually patient, although you may be known to exhibit the occasional, emotional outburst due to inattention to your own feelings. \r\n\r\nYou have a lot of natural ability which makes you good at many different kinds of things. However, you are happiest when you are centered in action-oriented tasks which require detailed, logical analysis and technical skill. You take pride in your ability to take the next, correct step. \r\n\r\nYou are optimistic, full of good cheer, loyal to your equals, uncomplicated in your desires, generous, trusting and a receptive person who wants no part in commitments that you perceive as confining. \r\n\r\nYou are fortunate because you have the ability to be good at many different kinds of tasks. Your preference to be more introverted and thought-oriented gives you the ability to concentrate and work through problems, and likely opens many doors for you. However, to be your happiest, you need to lead a lifestyle which offers a great deal of autonomy and does not include excessive, external enforcement of structure. You will definitely do best by working for yourself, or working in very flexible environments. Your natural interests lie in applying your skills of reasoning against known facts and data to discover underlying structure or solutions to practical questions. \r\n\r\nPeople that have your profile often find employment in the following fields of work: \r\n\r\n• Policemen and Detective work \r\n• Forensic Pathologists \r\n• Computer Programmers, System Analysts and Computer Specialists \r\n• Engineers \r\n• Carpenters \r\n• Mechanics \r\n• Pilots, Drivers, Motorcyclists \r\n• Athletes \r\n• Entrepreneurs \r\nAs you move forward, be careful to not alienate other people; for they are the key to you living a well-rounded, fulfilling life.

  { :name => "ISFP", :title => "The Independent Artisan ", :message => "You have very strong artistic inclinations, which you probably express through various forms of creativity, most likely in creating things that affect one's senses. You have a well developed sense, and a deep appreciation for, the way things look, feel, sound, taste, or smell. You tend to value the beauty of fine art and all things that are aesthetically pleasing. You are likely to be an animal-lover, and enjoy nature and the beauty if offers. Your strong core value system governs your behavior. You likely, strive to do what's “right” and you tend to resist anything that conflicts with those core beliefs. You most likely have gravitated toward a job that allows you the freedom to live your core values and work toward personal fulfillment. If you currently work in a career that doesn't provide you with this freedom, you are much more likely to feel deep internal discord and discontent: you may want to consider a career change. \r\n\r\nYou tend to be more quiet and withdrawn, making it hard for people to get to know you well. You aren't very vocal or forthcoming with your ideas, especially around people that you aren't close to or comfortable with. However, under the right circumstances, you are likely to express your perspective and opinions. Ultimately, you are kind, gentle and caring when dealing with people; and you tend to put a great deal of energy and resources into helping others feel happy and satisfied. \r\n\r\nYou are innovative and independent. You enjoy your personal time and “space” to accomplish these purposes. You appreciate people who take the time to understand you, and support your uniqueness. People that don't understand you may view your unique individuality as too light-hearted or careless. But in reality, you take life very seriously, persistently cycling information through your core, value system, searching for meaning and purpose. \r\n\r\nYou are action-oriented, more concerned with the practical application of an idea than the idea itself; and you prefer to do things with a “hands-on” approach. You may become bored with theoretical thinking. You don't like to make impersonal decisions based solely on the rules or the numbers. You prefer to weigh things against your own beliefs instead of objective rules. \r\n\r\nYou are very insightful when it comes to other people. Generally warm and considerate, you care about others and seek to serve them. You especially love those with whom you are close. You tend to express your concern through your actions more than your words. \r\n\r\nYou don't have a strong desire to lead others, just as you have little desire to be led by others. You value personal time and space to lead your own life. You likely tend to be somewhat of a perfectionist and too critical of yourself. It is important to avoid any ruts of discouragement and recognize the many talents you do possess—like your creativity, artistic aptitude, and desire to serve others. You take your life seriously, and you need the freedom to enjoy all that you feel life has to offer.
